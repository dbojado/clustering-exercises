# Clustering Exercises

## Summary
- Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning methodology    
- It is used to group and identify similar observations when we do not have labels that identify the groups    
-  It is often a preprocessing or an exploratory step in the data science pipeline  
- What groupings exist in the data already? (Clustering)
